# Bayes-Classifier-from-scratch

The Data set contains 10000 samples with two features x1 and x2 and four classes y ∈ {0,1,2,3}. The features are independent and identically distributed (iid).
The distributions are Gaussian with means (−1,−1) for class 0, (−1,1) for class 1, (1,1) for class 2, and (1,1) for class 3, respectively and the variances are
(σ12 = 0.1, σ22 = 0.1).

The prior probabilities of the classes are π(0) = 0.1, π(1) = 0.3, π(2) = 0.25, and π(3) = 0.35.

Created a bayes classifier using the given data.
